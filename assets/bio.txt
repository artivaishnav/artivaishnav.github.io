Yash vesikar is currently a software engineer at Microsoft working on their esports.
When he is not working until midnight, Yash enjoys going out for coffee and talking a lot about a plethora of subjects. This is because he has a lot of interests, including but not limited to: the way our world works, experiences heâ€™s had, the mountains. During his most recent times he has gotten into dog sitting and even running (follow him on Strava.)
He currently resides in Seattle, Washington and has two incredible friends named Anjuli and Chris.
